FishMaster
FishMaster is a mobile application designed to support Tamil Naduâ€™s coastal fishermen by addressing challenges such as overfishing, boundary violations, and inefficient resource usage. The app provides intelligent route planning, real-time alerts, marine data integration, and AI-powered assistance to promote sustainable and efficient fishing practices.
